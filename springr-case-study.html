					The original product concept asked users to record four types of personal data: <b>transportation, food consumption, purchases, </b>and <b>residence</b>. After logging and periodically updating information in their iPhone, the user would see an environmental score based on CO2 impact.
				</p>
				<p>
					My initial feedback was to focus on just one type of consumption and build a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">Minimum Viable Product</a>. This MVP would have a clear testable hypothysis, and seek to provide immediate and obvious value to the user.
				</p>
				<p>
					I decided to focus on transportation, well established sector with reliable data and the opportunity to supplant the majority of user data-entry. The iPhone can automatically log the information we would need to create a transportation score through the Core Motion Framework, and there were no shortcuts for logging food, shopping, or home data.
				</p>
				<p>
					Immediatly after the meeting I sent over a quick & dirty mockup of the new transportation focused idea. The ugly mock helped us begin to understand the complexity of the ‘simpler’ transportation-only app concept.

					 The team agreed that a more streamlined product would be a good place to start. It was important to get the concept in front of user quickly to create a better understanding of the specific issues and needs for urban transportation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Interviewing target users revealed that our initial aim of limiting leisure-time carbon use was misguided. Our respondents were not interested in forgoing a ski trip to Tahoe, but were interested in changing their commutes. With this finding, we attempted to understand why people choose not to carpool, bus, or bike on their commutes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Commuted are habitual, and presented an opportunity to help users make new transportation patterns. We’d use the iPhone’s sensors to detect types of motion, and gps for distance and location. The data would enable you to keep track of how you move through your life, and where there was opportunity to reduce the environmental impact of your choices.

		<h2 class="text-center">Getting to Work</h2>
			<p>Our guiding principles were simple:
				<ul>
					<li><h5>Build an app that is fun, approachable, and focused on real data.</h5></li>
					<li><h5>Fresh look and feel, don't rely ‘green’</h5></li>
					<li><h5>Always positive.</h5></li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				We used data from the team’s real transit choices to model realistic transportation personas for commuters. I led the team through ‘a day in the life’ exercises for each of our personas to understand the transportation choices our target users make everyday.
			</p>
			<p>
				 Visual design was built on top of real data. It is much easier to attach the product needs to realistic use cases when designing with  data. Using data from users or thoughtful models early in the visual design process protects the product from unnecessary assumptions and speeds up the process later in design.

			<h2>Trips</h2>
			<br>
			<p>
				I switched our base units from miles to trips to have a relitive, internally consistant measurement for all users. Trips is a much less 'critical' measurement than milage. Because Trips include walking, every user will have positive behaviors to build on even if they drive 100 miles to work every day.
			</p>
			<p>
				A trip has many attributes, a type (cycling, public transit, etc.), duration, and distance. From a technical perspective, Trips helps minimize the importance of precision tracking in the first Alpha version of the product when perfection is impossible.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each trip type has an implied rank. Walking, running, and cycling are the best transportation options, followed by public transit, and carpooling. Driving without a companion is the worst. Rather than explicitly state this hierarchy I used color and the architecture of the page to imply our ranking. We wanted to avoid overt negativity in the app, especially because frequent drivers have the largest opportunity for improvement.
			</p>
			<p>
				The implied rank is an important ‘anti-feature’. Removing explicit ranking allows the app to feel more friendly and avoid becoming a bad news delivery service. We also chose to remove the numerical score and focus on trips over time. Trips are a more salient concept than an app-generated score. Switching tied Springr's esseantial measurment to real-life behavior instead of an intabgible score.
			</p>
			<p>
				Trips, unlike miles or our numerical score, have inherent meaning. People understand that a trip has a beginning and an end, from A to B even if they don’t know the distance in between, or the cost of getting there. An qualitative a/b test of our simplified Springr interface suggested that ‘trip’ was clearer than using distance for the primary data unit.

			<p>
				The remaining challenge: how do we reward and visualize people doing less of a behavior? In golf, the minus sign is a measurment of success. In almost every other context, minus is a bad sign (bank account, temperature, etc).
			</p>
			<p>
				The minus sign literally indicates negativity. Similarly, the early charts showed a line graph going down and to the right as users reduced their carbon footprint. No one likes charts that go down and to the right.
			</p>
			<p>
				Visualizing trip data took many iterations, eventually deciding on a color-coded stacked bar chart. Early designs correctly treated our score as a continuous variable, but ‘trips’ are categorical (or discrete) data, and need to be displayed as such.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
		<h3 class="text-center">Cards</h3>
			<p>
				I chose to use cards rather than table rows for each type of trip. This allowed me to both remove the legend from the primary chart and provide more information in the expanded card view. I chose a simplified bar chart for each card, with an eye towards including more nuanced information in future iterations, like comparisons to historical values or community averages.
			</p>
			<p>
				Stacked cards like in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204003"> Apple Wallet</a> or <a href="https://vimeo.com/138725914">Corner</a> allow us to expose a ‘below the fold’ section without loading a new screen, providing a deeper dive with minimal user effort and no waiting. The tactile card metaphor supports the effort to make climate change tangible, and the idea that users are ‘card carrying members’ of a new environmental movement.

		<h3 class="text-center">Awards</h3>
			<p>
				From the begining, the team wanted a playful and gamified aspect to the product. The Awards screens is a series of badges earned as a user hits milestones for each type of trip (other than driving). It's like a small ‘pat on the back’ from Springr. The initial execution was rudimentary, without data to support badges as a 'sticky' feature I deprioritized designing a more robust system.
			</p>
		<br>
			<p>
				Badges & push notifications are areas in which qualitative analysis is insufficient to support a tactical decision, because the feature hypothesis depends on how disruptive/valuable they are in a real-world setting. Looking forward, once data can inform product and design choices in this area Awards and the related notifications will be refined.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
		<h3 class="text-center">Community</h3>
			<p>
			 	The purpose of the community page is to overcome the universal feeling that individual progress to reduce climate change is a ‘drop in the bucket’. The page visualizes the aggregate reduction in fuel used by the Springr community, and compares the effectiveness of each mode of transportation relative to the average driver.
			</p>
			<p>
				The algorithm we developed calculates the number of ‘cars taken off the road’ by comparing a population of average drivers to our population of users who walk, run, bike, share, and take mass transit in addition to driving. The aggregate distance traveled using a car alternative is weighted by carbon emissions (like our implied rank) and used to estimate the image of our community. The more people who join and refrain from driving alone, the larger the measurable impact of our community.

			Springr is a community platform that will shine as it grows. The initial version of the app is designed to lay the foundation for community growth by providing feedback to individuals about their transit choices, educating the user and Springr to improve our collective environmental impact.

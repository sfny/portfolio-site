		<h1>Leave This World A Little Better Than You Found It</h1>
		<h2>Intro</h2>
		<p>
			Climate change negatively impacts countless people around the globe. No matter what we do, we can’t reverse the damage that has been done. As new parts of the globe feel the effects of CO2 emissions, and as economic production speeds in faraway places, what can an individual do to make a difference?
		</p>
		<p>
			Awareness is not enough.<br>
			In addition to political action and economic penalties for destroying the natural world, we need individual accountability for the choices we make and the footprints we leave on the planet. We need to update the status quo, using data and collective accountability to remake conservationism.
		</p>

		<h2>First meeting</h2>
		<p>
			Two childhood friends, Jenny Goldman and Don Dianda, asked if I would meet for coffee to chat about their idea for an innovative product.The original project concept asked users to record four types of personal data with impact on their carbon footprint: transportation, food consumption, consumer goods, and residence. After logging and periodically updating this information in their iPhone, the user would be rewarded with a environmental score based on the CO2 impact.
		</p>
		[ ]*image of initial mock???*
		<p>
			My initial feedback was to focus on just one type of consumption, and jettison everything non-essential to build a Minimum Viable Product. The MVP would have to provide immediate and obvious value to the user, and a score was unlikely to suffice.
			My bias was to focus on transportation, a ‘hot’ and well established sector with reliable data and the opportunity to remove the need to user input. The iPhone can automatically log the information we would need to create a transportation score (Core Motion Framework), no such shortcut exists for food, shopping, or home data.
		</p>
		<p>
			Up to this point, I was acting as a product consultant with no larger involvement in the product. After the initial meeting I sent over a quick & dirty mockup of the new transportation focused idea, including the ‘gamified’ elements the team envisioned and the potential transportation integrations. The ugly mock helped us begin to understand the complexity of the ‘simpler’ transportation-only app concept.
		</p>
		[ ] *Ugly mock here*********
		<h2>Second Meeting</h2>
		<p>
			In the next meeting, I pitched the value of a transportation focused approach and the merit of omitting features. After external product validation it might be reasonable to widen the product scope, but it was to early to think beyond the difficult challenge of measuring and optimizing personal transportation choices.
		</p>
		<p>
			While initially hesitant to let go of the more expansive product concept, the team agreed that a more streamlined product would be a good place to start. I was resolved that getting the ideas in front of user quickly would give us a better understanding of the specific issues and needs for urban transportation. Specifically, we needed to understand why people choose not to carpool, bus, or bike on their commutes.
		</p>
		<p>
			We’d use the iPhone’s sensors to detect types of motion, and gps for distance and location. The data would enable you to keep track of how you move through your life, and where there was opportunity to reduce the environmental impact of your choices.
		</p>
		<h2>What Is Springr</h2>
		<p>
			Springr is a system for individuals to reduce climate change. It’s an app to measure and improve the environmental impact of your personal transportation choices. It’s a space to visualize your progress, your friend’s progress, and the  positive impact of a new environmental movement.
		</p>
		<h2>Getting to Work</h2>
			<p>The team and I agreed that I would design and prototype the product. I questioned the team and came up with a simple 	description of the design approach: build an app that feels fun and approachable while maintaining a focus on real data. Not too ‘green’. The new approach to climate change must develop a new visual language.</p>
			<p>
				I narrowed the initial product scope to serve only the Bay Area. With this, we had a testable first market and the opportunity to play to our strengths as SF locals who understand Bay Area transit. This reduced the number of assumptions we made about transportation ‘in general’ and allowed more data informed design process.</p>
			<p>
				We used data from the team’s real transit choices to model realistic transportation personas for commuters. I led the team through ‘a day in the life’ exercises for each of our personas to understand the transportation choices our target users make everyday.
			</p>
			<p>
				Incorporating real transportation data into the exercise helped us grasp the contexts in which people make decisions, and get a feel for the attitude discrepancy between commuting and leisure time. The needs of a commuter are very different than a weekend explorer, the resulting behaviors and motivations diverge greatly.</p>
			<p>
				Urban vs Suburban was another early challenge. In areas where suburban public transit is inadequate, there are fewer opportunities to reduce driving alone. This challenge proves especially tricky for our prototype scoring system, which used distance to approximate carbon output. How would someone who needs to drive 40 miles to work every day improve their score, particularly if there are no public transit option available?</p>
		<h2>Springr Theory of Relativity</h2>
			<p>
				There are times when the pieces of a product fall into place, and a solution becomes clear. For Springr, it came when I started using ‘trips’ as our atomic unit.
			</p>
			<p>
				A trip has many attributes, like type (cycling, public transit, etc.), duration, and distance. Trips allowed us to create comparable user scores, where a commuter who must drive 120 miles to work is not penalized more than someone who drives 1 mile to work. It also helps minimize the importance of  precision tracking in the first version of the product.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each trip type has an implied rank. Walking, running, and cycling are the best transportation options, followed by public transit, and carpooling. Driving without a companion is the worst. Rather than explicitly state this hierarchy I used color and the architecture of the page to imply our ranking.
			</p>
			<p>
				The implied rank is an important ‘anti-feature’. Removing explicit ranking helps the app feel more friendly, and stay away from a common product pitfall: becoming a *bad news delivery service.
			</p>
		<h3>Don’t Be A Bad News Delivery Service</h3>
			<p>
				Motivating users by exposing the ‘floor’ can be effective, but for a community-oriented app it’s more important to build an inclusive product. Users should not be derided (by an app!) because they have to drive a car to their jobs. Alienating drivers would also limit the greatest opportunity for carbon reduction, each driver on Springr who switches to public transit or cycling takes a car off the road.
			</p>
		<h3>Meaningful Behavior</h3>
			<p>
				We chose to kill the numerical score and instead focus on the trips someone goes on over time. The numerical score served as an aggregator in the app concept that also evaluated food and shopping, but for transportation it was an unnecessary obfuscation on top of the core value we provide.
			</p>
			<p>
				Trips, unlike miles or our numerical score, have inherent meaning. People understand that a trip has a beginning and an end, from A to B even if they don’t know the distance in between, or the cost of getting there. An qualitative a/b test of our simplified Springr interface suggested that ‘trip’ was clearer than using distance for the primary data unit.
			</p>
			<p>
				After I remove the score, new opportunities to display meaningful trip data appeared. It’s essential that the user understand their past behavior, but unlikely that the user will remember commuting (or any habitual behavior) from the previous month.
			</p>
			<p>
				A 7-day historical view provides a rhythm for the app. 7 day cycles suggest weekly progress and imply weekly opportunities for product messaging and interaction. Compared to months, weeks allow a better opportunity to reward positive behavioral change with new behaviors fresh in a user’s memory.
			</p>
		<h3>Data Vis</h3>
			<p>
				The remaining challenge: how do we reward and visualize people doing less of some behavior? In golf, the minus sign is a good thing. Hard to make that work in other contexts (bank account, temperature, etc).
			</p>
			<p>
				The minus sign literally indicates negativity. Similarly, the early charts showed a line graph going down and to the right as users reduced their carbon footprint. No one likes charts that go down and to the right.
			</p>
			<p>
				Visualizing trip data took many iterations, eventually deciding on a color-coded stacked bar chart. Early designs correctly treated our score as a continuous variable, but ‘trips’ are categorical (or discrete) data, and need to be displayed as such.
			</p>

		<h3>Cards</h3>
			<p>
				I chose to use cards rather than table rows for each type of trip. This allowed me to both remove the legend from the primary chart and provide more information in the expanded card view. I ended up using a simplified bar chart for each card, with an eye towards including more nuanced information in future iterations, like historical or community average comparisons.
			</p>
			<p>
				Stacked cards like in Passkit or [Corner](https://vimeo.com/138725914) allow us to expose a ‘below the fold’ section without loading a new screen, providing a deeper dive with minimal user effort and no waiting. The tactile card metaphor supports the effort to make climate change tangible, and the idea that users are ‘card carrying members’ of a new environmental movement.
			</p>
		<h3>Awards</h3>
			<p>
				From the begining, the team wanted a playful and gamified aspect to the product. The Awards screens is just that, a series of badges earned as a user hits milestones for each type of trip other than driving, a small ‘pat on the back’ from Springr. The initial execution was rudimentary, without data to support badges as a reengagement or behavior improvement feature a more robust Awards system was not a priority.
			</p>
		<br>
			<p>
				To this end, we added Taplytics to allow for flexible Push notification testing and in-app A/B test without an app release. Badges & push notifications are an area in which qualitative analysis is insufficient to support a tactical decision, because the feature hypothesis depends on how disruptive/valuable they are in a real-world setting. Looking forward, once data can inform product and design choices in this area Awards and the related notifications will be refined.
			</p>
		<h3>Community</h3>
			<p>
			 	The purpose of the community page is to overcome the universal feeling that individual progress to reduce climate change is a ‘drop in the bucket’. To do this, the community page visualizes the aggregate reduction in fuel used by the Springr community. We compare the effectiveness of each mode of transportation relative to the average driver, using recent government data for American drivers.
			</p>
			<p>
				The algorithm we developed calculates the number of ‘cars taken off the road’ by comparing a population of average drivers to our population of users who walk, run, bike, share, and take mass transit in addition to driving. The aggregate distance traveled using a car alternative is weighted by carbon emissions (like our implied rank) and used to estimate the image of our community. The more people who join and refrain from driving alone, the larger the measurable impact of our community. Yes, there are assumptions and and shortcuts build into this system, but it’s our conscious choice to emphasize usability and positivity in place of absolute precision in our initial app.
			</p>
		<h2>Final Final</h2>
		<p>Eventually, I ended up with this:</p>
		[ ] final screens
			<p>
				Initial usability testing did not go as expected. Surprisingly, testers were clear on the overall form and function of the profile page. The dummy data was easy to understand, and the value of the information was clear. Instead, I learned that testers didn’t want to explore the app as anticipated. The only way to navigate between pages was via the ‘hamburger’ menu and pop-out drawer on the left side. This was not particularly appealing to our testers unless they were directed to explore. Revised designs include horizontal swiping to navigate between pages, and a quick example of this interactive during the opboradirng flow. Future testing will reveal if a community element (graphic or button) on the primary page will help users explore to the community page, as community is fundamental to the product vision.
